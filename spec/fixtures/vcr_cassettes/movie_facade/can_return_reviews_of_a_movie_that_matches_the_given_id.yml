        Princess Bride is ultimately a story of love - of a grandather for his grandson,
        of Inigo Montoya for his murdered father and between Buttercup and Wesley.  It
        is an old fashioned fairy tale in a sense, but its imagination, wit and humour
        stands it apart from convention.  The characters are endearing and essential
        to the plot.  The pace of the film changes up and down beautifully throughout
        and the script is a joy, playing with words and ideas.  Humanity prevails
        in this wonderous tale, I learnt plenty from it as a child and I still watch
        it from time to time to remind me of the goodness within us and the ability
        to triumph over adversity.  The Princess Bride has a way of being traditional
        whilst challenging norms and that is why I will always love it.  10/10 for
        me.  The only criticism I have is that it is too male centric as many films
        and series still are unfortunately.  Although, saying that, Buttercup is much
        hardier than most princesses portrayed in children''s films.  This is a film
        that appeals to adults and children alike.  Stop writing did you say?  As
        you wish x","created_at":"2015-07-11T20:45:28.889Z","id":"55a18068c3a3681ce3001de7","updated_at":"2021-06-23T15:57:35.662Z","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/55a18068c3a3681ce3001de7"}],"total_pages":1,"total_results":1}'
